                            How eusociality (and cooperation in general) may have evolved is a question of great interest and importance in the field of biology. Several theories, such as Kin Selection [Hamilton 1963], Reciprocal Altruism [Trivers 1971], and Tug-of-War Theory [Reeve and H¨olldobler 2007], attempt to understand the evolution of such behaviour.
                            <br>
                            <br>This research will focus primarily on Tug-of-War Theory: specifically, the model proposed by Reeve and H¨olldobler [2007].
                            <br>
                            <br>Their model suggests that cooperative behaviour emerges as a bi-product of a nested tug-of-war. Agents within the same group compete for resources gathered by their group, and groups compete with each other for the limited resources available in the environment.

                        <p class="lead">
                            All agents in this model have the capacity for selfishness. They may choose to not expend any energy foraging for resources, knowing that they will get a share of what is collected by other agents in their group. This situation describes intragroup competition.
                            <br>
                            <br>Conversely, an agent may choose to expend its own limited energy searching for resources that will be shared amongst its group. This situation implicitly defines intragroup cooperation [Reeve and H¨olldobler 2007]. In the real world, superorganisms exhibit the following key organizational trends [Wilson and H¨olldobler 2005].
                            <br>
                            <br>(1) Cooperation is more likely to occur between agents with similar genetics.
                            <br>
                            <br>(2) Large colony sizes lead to higher levels of cooperation.
                            <br>
                            <br>(3) As colony size increases, brood output decreases.
                            <br>
                            <br>(4) Resource patchiness and inter-group competition are strongly associated with cooperation.
                            <br>
                            <br>By changing group size, levels of inter-group competition and genetic relatedness Reeve and H¨olldobler [2007] found that the above correlations emerged elegantly from their model.

                        <p class="lead">The above is evidence that the tug-of-war theory is a strong candidate for explaining the evolution of cooperation. The problem is its abstract nature.
                            <br>
                            <br> Many simplifications and generalizations are made in order to gain insight into the evolutionary process, but the complex behaviours of individuals and their interactions are not taken into account.
                            <br>
                            <br> Agent Based Systems can add to this area by being used to create and test meaningful models which are still based on the principle of observation of natural systems. Agent-based systems have proven invaluable as complementary tools in many different problem domains and fields.
                            <br>
                            <br> By incorporating complex features such as behavioural adaptation via evolution, an agent-based model is able to complement theoretical models by simulating behaviours that cannot otherwise be captured. Such a simulation would facilitate the evaluation of theories regarding the evolution of cooperation.</p>

                        By making use of a combination of both AI and Machine Learning techniques, it is possible to create agent controllers. The controller is responsible for actions of the agents, and must perform well for a given task. Although it is possible for these controllers to be designed by hand, there is no guarantee that they will lead to performant behaviour in agents.
                        <br>
                        <br>Neuro-Evolution in particular has been suggested as effective methods to create agent controllers in ABS [Baldassarre et al. 2003][Nolfi and Floreano 2000].

                            Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) (Palm, 1986) form an integral part of the NE process. ANNs are based on the biology of the brain, where the interconnected nodes making up the ANN can be compared to the interconnected neurons of the brain (Mitchell, 1997). The links between the nodes in the ANN can be thought of as synapses.

                            <br> Neuro-Evolution (NE) [Miikkulainen 2010] is the application of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The EA searches for specific network configurations within a set of candidate solutions. NE is used to modify multiple aspects of ANNs, such as weights and topologies within the ANN, which gradually allows an agent controlled by the ANN to learn.

                            By changing the levels of inter-group competition, Reeve and H¨olldobler [2007] found that the above correlations emerged elegantly from their model. To simulate this situation the levels of resource density will be altered during run which will bring a rise in inter-group cooperation among the agents.

                            <br>Inter-group competition will be facilitated by environmental factors such as resource availability and patchiness. One small resource patch in the world will lead to high competition, as all groups will have to fight for the limited resources. The more intragroup cooperation occurs, the higher the pool of collected resources for a group will be at the end of each iteration.

                        By tracking the energy amount of resources held by a group at the end of each iteration, we will be able to measure the amount of cooperation that occurred.
